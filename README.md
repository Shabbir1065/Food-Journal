# Food-Journal

In this app, users are able to log what food they eat, the exercises they have been doing as well as use a to-do list all within this one app.

Here is an analysis of how the different views communicated with each other while being ran. The project also uses OOP principles as one
can see in the image below through the creation of different objects to store the food and exercise journal information.
